# TheDailyJournal
I want to create a small python project to automatizate the creation of PDFs following basic templates, where the user enters the information in a simple UI and the program creates the PDF. The idea is to create a kind of "personal journal" but that has the aesthetic of a newpaper.


## Needed libraries:
- pip install PyQt5 reportlab pillow
- sudo apt-get install libxcb-xinerama0
- sudo apt-get install libxcb-xinerama0-dev
- sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
- pip install babel
